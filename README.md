# README

The purpose of this repository is to store shared R code for working with data from National Estuary Program (NEP) monitoring sites to: 
1. Filtering and QA/QC-ing data for analysis
2. Performing analysis on the data
3. Creating visualizations of data for communication and publication of results

File naming conventions:

The **PREFIX** of a file dictates the file's category:
- **qaqc_**: scripts containing R code for performing QA/QC and filtering of data
- **calc_**: scripts containing R code for running analysis on the data. This includes performing carbonate calculations, calculating uncertainties, or other statistical calculations.
- **plot_**: scripts containing R code for plotting visualizations of data
- **test_**: scripts written  for testing, practice, or reference material
